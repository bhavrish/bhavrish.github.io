I have a huge passion for coding, music, and math. I'll begin by talking about my first passion: coding. I began web development in high school, and started iOS Developmoent a year back. I have completed over 10 Hackathons till date and co-founded my first start-up, MoneyMiles, this year. When I am not coding, you can find me practicing the piano. I began playing the piano when I was 5 years old. Since then, I have performed in numerous concerts and have passed the ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) Level 8 Piano Exam, as well as completed the NYSSMA Piano Exams (up to level 6) with Honors. In high school, I ran a piano club where we taught other students how to play the piano, and performed at locations all over the city, from opera centers to nursing homes. Currently, in college, I am the Vice President of the chamber music chapter at my college. When I'm not coding or practicing the piano, I am also a huge fan of math competitions. I took advanced math classes in high school, and am currently minoring in math. I was also part of the math team in my high school, where I took many math competitions including the AMC 12, and qualified for AIME.\")), \" \"));\n  }\n\n}\n;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/bhaveshshah/Desktop/resume/src/components/about/about.js"],"names":["React","Component","About","render"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,eAAe,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBD,SAApB,CAA8B;AAC3CE,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,WACE;AAAS,MAAA,EAAE,EAAC,OAAZ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,KAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,eAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;AAA6B,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,uBAAjC;AAAyD,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAA7D;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MADF,CADF,EAIE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADF,EAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wvCAFF,CAJF,MADF,CADF;AAcD;;AAhB0C;AAiB5C","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nexport default class About extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section id=\"about\">\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"three columns\">\n            <img className=\"profile-pic\" src=\"images/profilepic.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"nine columns main-col\">\n            <h2>About Me</h2>\n            <p>Hi everyone, I'm Bhavesh and I'm a sophomore at Macaulay Honors College in NYC.
