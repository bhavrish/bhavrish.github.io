I'm Bhavesh and I'm a rising junior at Macaulay Honors College in NYC majoring in computer science. As a software engineer, most of my experience so far is in full stack web development and mobile development. As the CTO of MoneyMiles, a mobile startup I co-founded last year, I am currently helping build out the software infrastructure for our iOS application. On the side, I am also currently interning at Bank Novo, a fintech company based in NYC. When I am not coding, you can find me playing the piano. I began playing the piano when I was 5 years old. In high school, I ran a piano club in which we taught students how to play the piano, as well as performed at locations all over the city, from opera centers to nursing homes. Currently, in college, I am the Vice President of the chamber music chapter at my campus. When I'm not coding or practicing the piano, I am also a huge fan of math competitions. I took advanced math classes in high school, and am currently minoring in math. I was also part of the math team in my high school, where I took many math competitions including the AMC 12, and qualified for AIME. It's pretty hard to describe myself in 1 paragraph, but I hope you now have a better idea of me and my interests! I have a huge passion for coding, music, and math.\")), \" \"));\n  }\n\n}\n;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/bhaveshshah/Desktop/resume/src/components/about/about.js"],"names":["React","Component","About","render"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,eAAe,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBD,SAApB,CAA8B;AAC3CE,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACP,WACE;AAAS,MAAA,EAAE,EAAC,OAAZ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,KAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,eAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;AAA6B,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,uBAAjC;AAAyD,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAA7D;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,MADF,CADF,EAIE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBADF,EAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,yxCAFF,CAJF,MADF,CADF;AAsBD;;AAxB0C;AAyB5C","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nexport default class About extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section id=\"about\">\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"three columns\">\n            <img className=\"profile-pic\" src=\"images/profilepic.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"nine columns main-col\">\n            <h2>About Me</h2>\n            <p>Hi!
