I'm Bhavesh and I'm a sophomore at Macaulay Honors College in NYC. I have a huge passion for coding, music, and math. I'll begin by talking about my first passion: coding. I began web development in high school, and started iOS Development a year back. I have completed over 10 Hackathons till date and co-founded my first start-up, MoneyMiles, this year. When I am not coding, you can find me practicing the piano. I began playing the piano when I was 5 years old. Since then, I have performed in numerous concerts and have passed the ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) Level 8 Piano Exam, as well as completed the NYSSMA Piano Exams (up to level 6) with Honors. In high school, I ran a piano club where we taught other students how to play the piano, and performed at locations all over the city, from opera centers to nursing homes. Currently, in college, I am the Vice President of the chamber music chapter at my college. When I'm not coding or practicing the piano, I am also a huge fan of math competitions. I took advanced math classes in high school, and am currently minoring in math. I was also part of the math team in my high school, where I took many math competitions including the AMC 12, and qualified for AIME. It's pretty hard to describe myself in 1 paragraph, but I hope you now have a better idea of me and my interests!\")),\" \"));}}]);return About;}(Component);export{About as default};;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/bhaveshshah/Desktop/bhavrish.github.io/src/components/about/about.js"],"names":["React","Component","About"],"mappings":"k0BAAA,MAAOA,CAAAA,KAAP,EAAgBC,SAAhB,KAAiC,OAAjC,C,GACqBC,CAAAA,K,2PACV,CACP,MACE,gCAAS,EAAE,CAAC,OAAZ,EACE,2BAAK,SAAS,CAAC,KAAf,EACE,2BAAK,SAAS,CAAC,eAAf,EACE,2BAAK,SAAS,CAAC,aAAf,CAA6B,GAAG,CAAC,uBAAjC,CAAyD,GAAG,CAAC,EAA7D,EADF,CADF,CAIE,2BAAK,SAAS,CAAC,uBAAf,EACE,yCADF,CAEE,s3CAFF,CAJF,KADF,CADF,CAuBD,C,mBAzBgCD,S,SAAdC,K,aA0BpB","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nexport default class About extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section id=\"about\">\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"three columns\">\n            <img className=\"profile-pic\" src=\"images/profilepic.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"nine columns main-col\">\n            <h2>About Me</h2>\n            <p>Hi!
