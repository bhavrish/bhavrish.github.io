I'm Bhavesh and I'm a rising junior at Macaulay Honors College in NYC majoring in computer science. As a software engineer, most of my experience so far has been in full stack web development and mobile development. As the CTO of MoneyMiles, a mobile-app startup I co-founded last year, I am currently helping build out the software infrastructure for our iOS application. On the side, I am also interning at Bank Novo, a fintech company based in NYC. Whenever I get the chance, I try to participate in hackathons as well. Over the last 2 years, I have attended almost 10 hackathons ranging from RiceHacks in Texas to HackDartmouth in New Hampshire! Ouside coding, another huge passion of mine is playing the piano. I began playing the piano when I was 5 years old. In high school, I ran a piano club in which we taught students how to play the piano, as well as performed at locations all over the city, from opera centers to nursing homes. Currently, in college, I am also continuing this passion through co-leading the chamber music ensemble at my campus.
